# Pitch Response--Closet Share

First of all, I am very interested in the problem domain, as someone who loves fashion and art, but dislikes excessive consumption/purchasing. The solution is really interesting to me, and I really hope it would work, and I would love to know more about the app. 

## Some questions I wanted to ask are:
 - who is the target market?
    - students who live in living groups? working people who are interested in fashion? the same people who thrift--in person or online, like on depop or TheRealReal?
 - furthermore, what kind of clothing items?
    - luxury/occasion wear like cocktail/wedding dresses, daily wear but cheap/old, or fashionable/statement pieces

## Concern 1--Fashion taste/style recommendations/groups
I'm guessing the target market is a somewhat fashion-focused crowd because 1) people in need of functional clothes should spend time securing them by purchase or exchange, and 2) fashion-focused people are the ones spending time looking at clothes online most frequently. (I think the exchange clothes focused app could be interesting too!) 

If so, I feel like there is probably a narrow range of people this app can satisfy. 

For example, I can think of less than five people I know in the area I'd want to borrow clothes from regularly, only one of which are in my living group of 20+ girls. I would think it would be similar for people even more interested in fashion than me: because they have an established preference/taste in clothing, they'd probably want to give and take from a specific subset of closets within the community. A grouping by matched preferences would be very very interesting to hit this target audience. 

But otherwise, I think if people share a fashion interest with the people around them, this app would be very nice just the way it was pitched. 

## Concern 2--Clothing care/return

Borrowing is such a Trust thing. If users must be friends already outside of the app in order to interact, this might be mitigated. As a safety measure, to borrow higher quality pieces of clothing, it would be interesting if users had to pay a safety deposit of x amount to the app that they will be charged if the clothing is damaged or not returned.
