# Pitch Response: Palliative Care App

I chose to respond to this app because I really was so intrigued by the choice of problem domain. The points brought up about the stigma around discussing death, and the acceptance of death, reminded me of a book I read many years ago, "When Breath Becomes Air" by Paul Kalanithi: which is an autobiography written by a neurosurgeon in his final stages of lung cancer, and his experience with accepting pain, death, communicating with loved ones, and experiencing the patient side of healthcare. 

## Pitch Feedback: 
Listening to the pitch, I was confused by the time the team discussed the proposed solution. From their previous slides, I understood the most pressing problem in palliative care to be the scarcity of resources (less than 1 in 5 people receive necessary treatment). Such, I didn't understand *why* those were selected over more pressing problems in the domain (of course the selected problem areas themselves are very important, I think it's just the framing of the pitch that did the app a disadvantage). 

## App Feedback: 
I thought Arvind's feedback was super compelling: how can you  make this app patient centric? Of the four stated features of the app, I'm not sure which of the features a patient would not feel burdened by.
- Wishlist: I am not convinced that a patient who avoids discussing their death and reaching out to family members would willingly update wishlists on this app.
- Diary: Similarly, I'm also not sure patients would feel safe writing down their most personal feelings/diary style in this digital form where there is also so many other things going on. 
I think if anything, addressing the mental health issues (e.g. rates of isolation-induced loneliness/depression) using prompted reflection posts could be helpful FOR the user.
- Messages: And then, maybe as Daniel said, have the caretaker (in the case there is one) be a main stakeholder in the app.

## TLDR:
The app is in a very interesting domain, where any improvement is good. To improve the app, it is advised to check if the apps current planned features are *desired* by the target palliative care patients or even *feasible* in most cases.
