## Lucy Kim
### Class of 2025, 6-3

I'm an MIT junior from Dallas, TX. I am originally from South Korea. I currently live in WILG, the Women's Independent Living Group at MIT.

I'm looking forward to learning more about creating social media apps, because I want to become an indie programmer that can implement ideas immediately.
