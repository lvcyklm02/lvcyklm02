## Design Reflection

Once I started my implementation of my backend, I realized I unified a lot of different features (Location, account, genre, techniques) into one concept Tag. I think I'm going to continue developing a Tag concept and differentiate initiation of doc collections at the application level and routing. I additionally realized a big concept like a scheduler needs many concept-size parts like event (with registration functionality), calendar.
